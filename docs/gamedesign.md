## Modules
Modules are organized into types, with multiple tiers and variants existing for each.

### Living Quarters
Living quarters support station personnel.  Each have scores for comfort, resource consumption, and other qualities.
* Barracks
* Apartments
* Suites
* Private Cabin

### Production
Production modules all have two things in common: they take in some resource, and output another.  Generally, lower tiers require little to no maintenance, but produce small amounts of the resource.  Higher tiers require more people and inputs, but have a higher return.
